I"<p>I am Firdha Maulidya.<br /><br />
One of my first dreams in school, is developing energy in Indonesia. I graduated from Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bachelor of Geophysical Engineering. Since joining workshops and training in geoscience, to join an apprenticeship program in an oil company, I have learned from the real work experience in the energy sector. A plot twist is a new knowledge in data management, database, data analytics in energy. I love it!</p>

<p>As a cross major, itâ€™s very challenging. But, I love analyzing data and finding the missing solution based on historical data. Moreover, it can be amazing if I can connect to financial and management system.</p>

<p>Currently, I work as a data analyst and Quantity Assurance consultant in private company. I am also interested to continue my study in order to boost my career in the management industry.<br /></p>
